                        <p>Keeping the same notion in mind KALAPRAGAN TRUST was founded by Dr.Pallavi nayik in 2014 in Thane (Mumbai). We are extremely glad and proud to see that our dream has come true.Looking at the success of the Nritya Kendra where we have more than 200 students learning the art form Bharatnatym, we dedicate this achievement to our Guru as well as our parents. We also thank all the people who showed their support and love to our KALAPRAGAN. With the blessings of our Guru, Parents and all the people who supported us, our KALAPRAGAN TRUST is standing tall and gracefully spreading the knowledge.When we started the classes, we were just following our Guru’s foot-steps. But today, looking at the growth and response </p>
